		"Well, not anymore!",
		"No. I care about my health.",
		"I don't want to die young, so I'm quitting right now... Well, maybe tomorrow, you know?",
		"Oh yeah. You can't just quit cold turkey. That's more dangerous than continuing to eat McDonald's for the rest of your life!",
		"Oh! Well, in that case, I don't think it's a good idea to quit at all.",
		"You're right. I'm going to continue eating for the rest of my life. It is delicous after all.",
		"Nothing is more delicous than McDonald's."

		"I go to the gym every day. I work out for five hours every day.",
		"That's really impressive! How do make time for that?",
		"It's simple. You've just got to get on that sigma grind, you know.",
		"That makes sense. How does one get on the grind, man?",
		"It's easy. You work out, quit drugs, and, the most important step, receive a one million dollar loan from your dad.",
		"Oh! That sounds easy. I'm going to start tomorrow!"
